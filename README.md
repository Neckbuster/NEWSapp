# NEWSapp
A Web-App that hosts leading news and different newspapers of various countries on a common platform..

This is a Progressive Web Application, that consumes the 'News API' for providing Top News Headlines,
Generalised News Feed, and links to leading Newspapers of different countries. The main motive of this 
project is to enable people to access news that has not been affected by any fabricated promotions, and
the reader can choose what news to prefer.

# Technologies
This project is currently based on HTML, CSS and JS. These have been uilised for the creation of an 
interesting UI, consumption and customisation of the api provided by newsapi.org .

# How to Build?
Since it is a simple Web-App, it acts just as a simple website. So yiu can clone the code into 
your local machine and run the website by hosting the files on any 
platform as per choice. You can also use GiHub Pages for hosting your version of the website.
We will also host various designs for the UI which can be used by the user as they prefer.
